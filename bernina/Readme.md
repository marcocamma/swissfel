# Overview

These scripts are a collection of some of those used during the commissioning experiment at SwissFEL (time resolved powder diffraction on Titanium Pentaoxide)
They are a bit of a mess since they have been written during beamtime but maybe useful for someone ?
The most important one is the tiox_jf_utils.py

# Usage

See jupyter notebooks
